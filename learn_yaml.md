# How to learn this Step -by- step (CI/CD ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí YAML)

## Step 1: Understand CI/CD basics:
- **CI/CD = pipeline of stages:** Source ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy ‚Üí Monitor.
- **Analogy:** like your cake story
- At this stage you don't write YAML, just learn concepts.
`‚úÖ Goal: be able to answer ‚Äî ‚ÄúWhat happens in Source, Build, Test, Deploy, Monitor?‚Äù`


# Step 2: Learn GitHub Actions (what, why, how)
* GitHub Actions = GitHub‚Äôs built-in CI/CD platform.
* Core ideas:
   - `Workflow` = one automation (YAML file inside .github/workflows/).
   - `Trigger (on:)` = when it runs (push, PR, manual, cron).
   - `Job` = a set of steps that run on a runner (VM).
   - `Step` = one action (uses prebuilt action) or shell command (run).
   - `Action` = reusable building block (actions/checkout, actions/setup-node, etc.).
`‚úÖ Goal: understand the vocabulary of GitHub Actions.`

# Step 3 : Learn YAML Basics: 
- YAML is just a configuration format.
- Rules you need: 
   - Use spaces, not tabs
   - key-value: `key:value`
   - Lists:
      **steps:**
      `  - name: First`
      `    run: echo hello`
      `  - name: Second`
      `    run: echo world`
<!-- Comments start with # -->
* Practice writing small YAML workflows (like the "Hello World" or your Source Trigger Demo).
`‚úÖ Goal: be comfortable writing a valid YAML workflow file.`


# Step 4: Map CI/CD stages ‚Üí Actions YAML
Now you combine:

- Source = on: (push, PR).
- Build = jobs/steps to compile, lint, or build Docker image.
- Test = run unit/integration tests.
- Deploy = push image to Docker Hub / deploy to cloud.
- Monitor = notifications or integration with monitoring tools.
`‚úÖ Goal: You can take a CI/CD diagram and express it as a GitHub Action workflow.`

# Step 5: Practice on your repo
- Start small (Source + Build + Test).
- Then expand with artifacts, Docker, deployments.
- Use your README‚Äôs examples as building blocks.

#  üó∫Ô∏è So your learning flow should be:
1. CI/CD concepts (theory) ‚Üí cake analogy you wrote.
2. GitHub Actions fundamentals ‚Üí workflows, jobs, steps, runners.
3. YAML basics ‚Üí formatting + writing files.
4. Build workflows for each stage ‚Üí first Source (‚úÖ you did this), then Build, Test, Deploy.
5. Full CI/CD pipeline ‚Üí combine everything.>

## Learning Notes:
- runs-on: ‚Üí defines  VM environment (Ubuntu, Windows, MacOS)
- `uses:`  vs `run:` :
   - **uses:** = calls a prebuilt Github Action (like checkout or setup-node)
   - **run:** = executes shell commands inside the runner VM.
- Artifacts ‚Üí super useful if you want to pass build outputs (like a compiled binary or Docker Image) to the next-stage (Test/Deploy)


## Quick Exercise : 
1. Add this workflow to your repo.
2. Push a commit to main (or open a PR)
3. Go to Action Tab ‚Üí click Build Stage Demo run.
4. Check:
   - Did it install Node and dependencies ?
   - Did it run lint/built?
   - Can you download the artifact (build-dist.zip)?
